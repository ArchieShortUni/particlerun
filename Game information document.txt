How to play / controls:
- The aim of the game is to get the particles through the run avoiding obsticles and into the collector
- You control the game by clicking the mouse (mouse is heavily reccomended) 
- holding the mouse click down will suspend gravity 
- you can save and load by pressing l or s (just name them you don't need to add the extension)

Level editor: 
- has its own seperate controls, use the mouse to click where you want a component to go
- use r to rotate and the arrow keys to adjust the size of walls and hazard blocks (allows you to make the level however you want)
- once saved (there is a button) you can load up levels you've made through the level select button

If you try and save without having a spawner and collector you will run into problems

Extra feature:
- The main extra feature is the level editor that lets you create levels with ease, store them and then select which you want to play
- The level editor has its own mouse handler and keyAdapter as well as storing all data wasting as little space as possible
- The user made levels work in exactly the same way as the hard coded levels keeping track of your score and other variables 
- The user made levels can also be saved / loaded using l or s

Saving / loading:
- The saving and loading system doesn't just keep track of the level you're on and your score it also keeps track of 
every single particles position and when loaded back up places them all back to where they left off
- as stated above the Saving / loading also works with custom made levels

Complex features:
- The way you control the swarm of particles using matrix manipulation
- The way portals work as they retain your position from center and angle as they eject
- The way components of the level are stored in the levelEditorData class linked with the editor current and levelEditor
- The way particles interact with eachother and the obsticles such as the gravity well
- The construction of the level editor

Documentation:
The three complex classes documented are
- ParticleCol
- customLevel
- portal
For some reason I couldn't get the comments to appear in the html javadoc but if you look at the classes you will see the documentation



NOTE ABOUT TEXTURES; 
I created a fair amount of textures to use on a lot of the bodies (can find in the data file) 
however in the end I opted not to use them as the game looked better from a more simplistic view and 
doing textures for the walls in the level editor would've been a great challenge having to do custom generation
of textures so I thought it would be jarring to see have the walls textured on one part but not the rest
